# ðŸ“ˆ INFY Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple stock price prediction model using **Linear Regression** on Infosys Limited (INFY.NS) stock data for the year 2022.

We fetch historical stock data using the `yfinance` library and train a model to predict the **closing price** based on features like open, high, low, and volume.

---

## ðŸ“Š Output Snapshot
The model's performance is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and visualized with a plot comparing the predicted and actual closing prices.

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data handling
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Plotting and visualization
- **yFinance** â€“ Fetching stock market data
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine Learning (Linear Regression, train-test split, metrics)
